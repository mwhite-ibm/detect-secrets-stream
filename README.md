# Detect Secrets Stream [![Build Status](https://travis.ibm.com/git-defenders/detect-secrets-stream.svg?token=tSTYkwXezbKBusqJ3V4L&branch=master)](https://travis.ibm.com/git-defenders/detect-secrets-stream)

## Description

Detect secrets stream is the server tool which ingests meta data of all (public repo by default, private repo opt-in) git pushes happened on github.ibm.com. For each push, it [scans](https://github.ibm.com/Whitewater/whitewater-detect-secrets/wiki/About-Detect-Secrets#what-file-content-do-you-scan) the push content for secrets. Once found and verified, secrets will be stored in db (meta data) and SoS vault (raw secret).

The live secrets are reported to Vulnerability Management team (VMT). Currently the reporting is through csv file uploaded in shared box folder. We are about to change to [report through read-only DB table](https://github.ibm.com/git-defenders/detect-secrets-discuss/issues/310).

There is another companion [Admin tool](https://github.ibm.com/Whitewater/whitewater-detect-secrets/wiki/Admin-Tool-FAQ) which enables org admin to

- opt-in their private repo for scanning
- add security folk for leak token notification.

Under the hood, server tool uses developer tool to scan for secrets. Read [Whitewater/whitewater-detect-secrets](https://github.ibm.com/Whitewater/whitewater-detect-secrets) for more info about developer tool.

## Development

### Tool dependencies

- python3
  - If you are using macOs, you can use `pyenv` to install Python 3 `brew install pyenv; pyenv install 3.8.5;`
  - Optionally, you can setup your system default Python as Python 3 `pyenv global 3.8.5`. Then restart your shell. Run `python --version` to validate the default python is 3 now.
- docker https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
- docker-compose installed along with docker
- skaffold, v1.12.1 and above
- kustomize, v3.8.1 and above. Do **NOT** use the version bundled with kubectl, it does not support some options we use (e.g. replicas).
- container-structure-test, used for docker image validation - [installation](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/container-structure-test#installation).
- pipenv, used to manage all Python dependencies.

You can install all the tools except docker and python 3 with one liner below

```shell
brew install kustomize skaffold container-structure-test pipenv
```

### Python package dependencies

- Navigate into the clone repo
- Start pipenv shell with `pipenv shell`
- Install python dependencies with `pipenv install --dev`
- Initialize the pre-commit tool with `pre-commit install`

## Local dev secrets

To set up your local dev secrets, first run `./kustomize_envs/dev/gen-secret.sh`. It will create two hidden folders under `/kustomize_envs/dev/`:

- `secret_generated/` containing automatically-generated secrets. Secrets get regenerated when re-running `gen-secret.sh`.
- `secret_manual/` containing manually-entered secrets. Running `gen-secret.sh` will generate a template for secrets under this folder. You do need to manually update each secret to match your environment. Re-running `gen-secret.sh` will not overwrite the files if they are non-empty.

This table contains information on what the values of the manually-entered secrets should be set to:
| File name | Value |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app.key` | The test GitHub App's private key. Download this from the GitHub App config UI. |
| `env.txt` | The test GitHub App's app ID. Obtained from the GitHub App config UI. |
| `db2consv_zs.lic` | The IBM DB2 license certificate file. You can read more about how to retrieve it [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.1?topic=configuring-db2-licenses). This is only needed if looking for DB2 for z or DB2 for i secrets. |
| `email.conf` | Your company's internal email regex. Replace `mycompany.com` with your company's email domain. |
| `ghe_revocation.token` | The Jenkins job trigger token to revoke the GHE token. |
| `github.conf` | `github.mycompany.com` - replace this with your company's GHE domain. `tokens` - a list of GitHub API tokens. This token pool is necessary for when a single token's rate limit has been reached. `<org>` and `<repo>` should be replaced with the organization/repository containing the org set configuration for private repository scanning - technically this is only used by the VMT Reporter, which doesn't run as part of a dev setup.|
| `iam.conf` | The IBM Cloud IAM API key for an admin account which can resolve an IBM Cloud IAM token owner. |
| `kafka.conf` | `brokers_sasl` - comma-separated Kafka broker list. For example `broker-1:9093,broker-2:9093,broker-3:9093`. `api_key` - Kafka API key to publish and consume from the queue. When using [IBM Cloud Events Stream service](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/event-streams), you can obtain such value from the Events Stream console by navigating to the Service credentials panel and creating a new service credential. `brokers_sasl` is the value of `kafka_brokers_sasl` (without `"` or spaces) from your service credential. `api_key` is the value of `api_key` from your service credential. |
| `revoker_urls.conf` | Replace `github.mycompany.com` with your company's GHE URL, `artifactory` with your company's artifactory URL, and `jenkins` with your company's Jenkins URL, which should contain a Jenkins job to revoke the GHE token. |

## Tests

### Unit tests

You don't need to unlock secrets when running unit tests.

```shell
make test
```

#### Run just unit test

```shell
make test-unit
```

#### Run a subset of unit tests.

It provides faster feedback if you are just writing code for a module.

```shell
# The part after last dash (-) corresponding to folder name under detect_secrets_stream
# For example, run unit test for just files under bp_lookup
make test-unit-bp_lookup
# Run unit test for just files under pi_cleaner
make test-unit-pi_cleaner
```

### End 2 end test

This requires a personal env or staging env. See [kustomize_envs/dev/README.md](kustomize_envs/dev/README.md) for more details.

## Utilities

This repo has provided a utility module which enables admin to do many routine tasks. The utility is invoked though `python -m detect_secrets_stream.util.secret_util`

Running the utility requires several environment variables. You would first unlock secrets with `git-crypt` (secret management section above), then export required environment variables. One example env var file `.env.example` has been prepared to help you.

In `fish` shell, you can do something like below

```shell
cp .env.example .env.prod
env (grep -v '^#' .env.prod | xargs -n1) python -m detect_secrets_stream.util.secret_util --help
```

### Decrypt raw tokens

Based on id

```shell
python -m detect_secrets_stream.util.secret_util decrypt-token-by-id [token_id]
```

Based on UUID

```shell
python -m detect_secrets_stream.util.secret_util decrypt-token-by-uuid [uuid]
```

### Validating Admin Tool Org Admins

```bash

python -m detect_secrets_stream.util.secret_util get-org-admins [ORG_NAME]
```

### Backfill tokens

```bash
# export require env vars

# macos
python -m detect_secrets_stream.util.secret_util backfill --size=10000 --from $(date -j -f "%a %b %d %T %Z %Y" "Wed Sep 11 00:00:00 EDT 2019" +"%s") --to $(date -j -
f "%a %b %d %T %Z %Y" "Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 EDT 2019" +"%s")

# linux
python -m detect_secrets_stream.util.secret_util backfill --size=10000 --from $(date -d '06/12/2012 07:21:22' +"%s") --to $(date -d '06/12/2012 08:21:22' +"%s")
```

### Manually ingest token

Manually add a commit to the `diff-scan` queue.

Note: must set `KAFKA_CLIENT_ID` , `GD_KAFKA_CONF` environment variables.

`KAFKA_CLIENT_ID` is the name of kafka client used in manual ingestion. It can be anything, such as `manual-ingest`
`GD_KAFKA_CONF` points to the Kafka configuration file. The production config is stored under `kustomize_envs/prod-secrets/secret/kafka.conf`. The one below is an example of what should be contained in the conf file.

```conf
[kafka]
brokers_sasl = my_sasl1.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud:9000,my_sasl2.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud:9000,my_sasl3.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud:9000
api_key = my_api_key
```

Sample usage:

```bash
# export require env vars
python -m detect_secrets_stream.util.secret_util ingest-commit -r <repo> -c <commit>
```

More options: running the command above with `--help` will reveal help info on more options. For example, if you know the branch and repo visibility, you can also supply these.
By default it assumes the commit is from master granch and repo visibility is public.

### and more...

```shell
python -m detect_secrets_stream.util.secret_util --help
```

## PI Disposal Process

The mechanism for removing old secrets is a [cronjob](/kustomize_envs/base/pi_cleaner/cronjob.yaml) which cleans PI on a daily basis.

It removes the following PI for all tokens that have been remediated for over seven days:

- Owner email
- Secret
- Encrypted secret
- Other factors
- Author name
- Author email
- Pusher username
- Pusher email
- Committer name
- Committer email
- Repo slug
- Location url

## Re-validation Process

Every four hours, a [cronjob]('/kustomize_envs/base/revalidation') checks if all live tokens in the database are still live and updates their statuses accordingly.
